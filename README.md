# Coursera-Chapter-8-Final
My repository of Chapter 8 final project.

Part 1 is okay. Part 2 needs some work. There are a couple of things I have to solve. 

First, I was told that function `app_run_server` is obsolete so I changed it to `app_run`. 
Then I tried to run on the browser which resulted in this [Type Error](https://github.com/WeakestLinuxEnjoyer/Coursera-Chapter-8-Final/blob/main/Final2_error-browser-firefox.png).
I copied the file to the Jupyter Notebook, resulting in [Internal Server Error](https://github.com/WeakestLinuxEnjoyer/Coursera-Chapter-8-Final/blob/main/Final2_jupyter-error.png).
I have also included the full error text in the [txt file](https://github.com/WeakestLinuxEnjoyer/Coursera-Chapter-8-Final/blob/main/Final_error-text.txt).
